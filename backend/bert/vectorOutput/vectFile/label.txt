COMP1000, "World wide web WWW  dependent activities have become an essential part of our existence and yet many of us do not know much about how they works. In the first part of this course, we introduce the abstract features of the internet and the software that makes it so powerful. Knowledge about the architecure of the internet, world wide web, browsers, seach engines, e-commerce, security, etc. will be helpful in using the internet more effectively as well as becoming aware of the several pifalls associated with this modern technology.   Spreadsheets and databases are two of the most commonly used and powerful computer tools yet they are often poorly utilised and the reasons for using one rather than the other are poorly understood. Many people purchase Microsoft Office which comes bundled with Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access - a spreadsheet and a database application - yet while many people have some familiarity with Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access is rarely utilised. This course aims to explain in straightforward terms the concepts underlying both of these powerful pieces of software so that students can exploit them effectively for both their studies and future careers. It will investigate how to design and implement effective spreadsheet and database applications. Students should also be able to transfer these skills to other, similar spreadsheet and database packages.

COMP6721, " In- Formal Methods are practical structuring and design patterns that encourage programming that is easy to understand and to maintain. They are only a part of the large body of  good programming practices, distinguished from that larger set because -for the methods we consider- the computer science community has determined the science behind the structures: we know why they are effective.Unusually, this course does not take the traditional route of teaching that science first, and then turning it into practical programming  tools-of-thought. Instead, we teach the mental tools first, try them on examples and only then, once their effectiveness has been demonstrated, will we look behind the scenes to see where they come from.Initially the material will deal with conventional programs, those that much  give the right output.  this is known as functional correctness, and a sorting program is a simple example. Later in the course we will look at additional correctness criteria, such as security  perform this calculation in a way that keeps part of the answer hidden  and randomisation  implement over-the-internet protocols that depend intrinsically on coin-flipping.

COMP6741, "The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.   The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure &amp; conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the  Strong  Exponential Time Hypothesis.   Whereas the first part presents  default  algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f k *poly n  for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization  preprocessing. We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions.     "

What makes a game balanced?This subject aims to bring together students from Digital Media, Media and Communications and Computer Science to work in teams together to invent, prototype and workshop games. The focus is on the design of play, not on programming or graphics. An iterative design process is used, involving prototyping and playtesting. There will also be guest lectures from the games industry.     "

COMP4511, "This course is a project-based course designed to build on the basic skills acquired in COMP3511 &ndash; Human Computer Interaction. The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application.   The course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns. Whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application, this is not the focus of the course, which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces.

COMP6721, " In- Formal Methods are practical structuring and design patterns that encourage programming that is easy to understand and to maintain. They are only a part of the large body of  good programming practices, distinguished from that larger set because -for the methods we consider- the computer science community has determined the science behind the structures: we know why they are effective.Unusually, this course does not take the traditional route of teaching that science first, and then turning it into practical programming  tools-of-thought. Instead, we teach the mental tools first, try them on examples and only then, once their effectiveness has been demonstrated, will we look behind the scenes to see where they come from.Initially the material will deal with conventional programs, those that much  give the right output.  this is known as functional correctness, and a sorting program is a simple example. Later in the course we will look at additional correctness criteria, such as security  perform this calculation in a way that keeps part of the answer hidden  and randomisation  implement over-the-internet protocols that depend intrinsically on coin-flipping.

COMP6741, "The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.   The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure &amp; conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the  Strong  Exponential Time Hypothesis.   Whereas the first part presents  default  algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f k *poly n  for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization  preprocessing. We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions.     "

This course therefore serves as an examination of the broad sweep of Australian art and the way exhibitions in public galleries have shaped  and continue to shape  our understanding of the art of this country. Although the course will look at some of the earlier interpretations of Australian art, it will concentrate on the new curatorial scholarship that has emerged since the 1970s.   Questions that will be examined include the repositioning of Aboriginal art as being central to any understanding of Australian visual culture, the gradual inclusion of women in the narrative; the growing awareness that the arts can reflect the concerns of the broad spectrum of Australian society.
