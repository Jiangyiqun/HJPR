The topics to be studied are: Manifolds, tangent spaces, differential forms local and global, de Rham cohomology, Stokes's theorem in n dimensions. Topological and geometric applications. Will be announced at the start of the course.1. Knowledge. The student has knowledge of fundamental concepts and methods concerning differential forms, de Rham cohomology and integration on manifolds.2. Skills. The student is able to apply his or her knowledge of differential topology to formulate and solve problem of an analytic-geometrical nature in mathematics, theoretical physics and cybernetics, through the use of integration on manifolds and other tools."

The subject is primarly offered to established ensembles, not to one student without an ensemble. The ensemble should be sentral and natural for the instruments, for exampel contemporary music ensembles, baroque-ensembles, trios, quartets and similar. The candidate:-Has been trained in ensemble playing and in how to agree on the musical intentions of the ensemble.-Has knowledge about relevant chamber music repertoire.-Can present and communicate chamber music to the audience.-Has knowledge about the style and the possible ways of interpretation of styles in the music they play."
