    "courseCode": "MA3402",
    "courseDesc": "The course deals with fundamental concepts from differential topology, providing a connection between topology and analysis and an understanding of modern geometric reasoning. The topics to be studied are: Manifolds, tangent spaces, differential forms local and global, de Rham cohomology, Stokes's theorem in n dimensions. Topological and geometric applications. Will be announced at the start of the course.1. Knowledge. The student has knowledge of fundamental concepts and methods concerning differential forms, de Rham cohomology and integration on manifolds.2. Skills. The student is able to apply his or her knowledge of differential topology to formulate and solve problem of an analytic-geometrical nature in mathematics, theoretical physics and cybernetics, through the use of integration on manifolds and other tools."
